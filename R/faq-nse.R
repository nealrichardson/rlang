#' What is data-masking and why do I need embracing with `{{`?

#'
#' Data-masking is a distinctive feature of R whereby programming is
#' performed directly on a data set, with columns defined as normal
#' objects.
#'
#' ```{r, error = TRUE, comment = "#>", collapse = TRUE}
#' # Unmasked programming
#' mean(mtcars$cyl + mtcars$am)
#'
#' # Referring to columns is an error - Where is the data?
#' mean(cyl + am)
#'
#' # Data-masking
#' with(mtcars, mean(cyl + am))
#' ```
#'
#' While data-masking makes it easy to program interactively with data
#' frames, it makes it harder to create functions. Passing data-masked
#' arguments to functions requires injection with `{{` (known as
#' [embracing][embracing]) or, in more complex cases, `!!`.
#'
#'
#' @section Why does data-masking require embracing and injection?:
#'
#' Injection (also known as quasiquotation) is a metaprogramming
#' feature that allows you to modify parts of a program. This is
#' needed because under the hood data-masking works by
#' [defusing][defusing] R code to prevent its immediate evaluation.
#' The defused code is resumed later on in a context where data frame
#' columns are defined.
#'
#' ```{r, error = TRUE, comment = "#>", collapse = TRUE}
#' my_mean <- function(data, var1, var2) {
#'   dplyr::summarise(data, mean(var1 + var2))
#' }
#'
#' my_mean(mtcars, cyl, am)
#' ```
#'
#' The problem here is that `summarise()` defuses the R code it was
#' supplied, i.e. `mean(var1 + var2)`.  Instead we want it to see
#' `mean(cyl + am)`. This is why we need metaprogramming, we need to
#' modify that piece of code by injecting the code supplied to the
#' function in place of `var1` and `var2`. The easiest way to achieve
#' that is with `{{`.
#'
#' ```{r, comment = "#>", collapse = TRUE}
#' my_mean <- function(data, var1, var2) {
#'   dplyr::summarise(data, mean({{ var1 }} + {{ var2 }}))
#' }
#'
#' my_mean(mtcars, cyl, am)
#' ```
#'
#' Technically, `{{` performs two steps: defusal and injection. It
#' defuses the code supplied to our own function and injects it back
#' into another function. This defuse-and-inject pattern can also be
#' performed in distinct steps with [enquo()] and [`!!`][injecting].
#'
#'
#' @section What does "masking" mean?:
#'
#' In normal programming you define objects in the current
#' environment, for instance in the global environment or the
#' environment of the function you are writing.
#'
#' ```{r, comment = "#>", collapse = TRUE}
#' factor <- 1000
#'
#' # Can now use `factor` in computations
#' mean(mtcars$cyl * factor)
#' ```
#'
#' This environment also contains all functions currently in scope. In
#' a script this includes the functions attached with `library()`
#' calls; in a package, the functions imported from other packages.
#'
#' If evaluation was performed in a data frame only, we'd lose track
#' of these objects and functions necessary to perform computations.
#' Hence the data are included in a chain of environments where it
#' comes first and has precedence over the user environment. In other
#' words, it _masks_ the user environment.
#'
#' The easiest way to see this is to define an object with the same
#' name as a column. The latter has precedence because data-variables
#' come before env-variables:
#'
#' ```{r, comment = "#>", collapse = TRUE}
#' # Defining an env-variable
#' cyl <- 1000
#'
#' # Referring to a data-variable
#' dplyr::summarise(mtcars, mean(cyl))
#' ```
#'
#' Note that the tidy eval framework provides [pronouns][.data] to
#' disambiguate between the mask and user contexts. It is often a good
#' idea to use these pronouns in production code. The `.env` pronoun
#' is particularly useful when working with abritrary data frames to
#' prevent a column from inadvertently masking a user variable.
#'
#' ```{r, comment = "#>", collapse = TRUE}
#' cyl <- 1000
#'
#' mtcars %>%
#'   dplyr::summarise(
#'     mean(.data$cyl),
#'     mean(.env$cyl)
#'   )
#' ```
#'
#'
#' @section How does data-masking work?:
#'
#' Data-masking relies on three language features:
#'
#' - [Argument defusing][defusing] (also known as quoting or NSE) with
#'   [substitute()] (base R) or [enquo()] and [enquos()] (rlang). R
#'   code needs to be defused so it can be evaluated later on in a
#'   modified context.
#'
#' - First class environments. Environments are a special type of
#'   list-like object in which defused R code can be evaluated.  The
#'   named elements in an environment define objects. Lists and data
#'   frames can be transformed to environments:
#'
#'   ```
#'   as.environment(mtcars)
#'   #> <environment: 0x7febb17e3468>
#'   ```
#'
#' - Explicit evaluation with [eval()] (base) or [eval_tidy()]
#'   (rlang). When R code is defused, evaluation is interrupted. It
#'   can be resumed later on with [eval()]:
#'
#'   ```{r, comment = "#>", collapse = TRUE}
#'   expr(1 + 1)
#'
#'   eval(expr(1 + 1))
#'   ```
#'
#'   By default `eval()` and `eval_tidy()` evaluate in the current
#'   environment.
#'
#'   ```{r, error = TRUE, comment = "#>", collapse = TRUE}
#'   code <- expr(mean(cyl + am))
#'   eval(code)
#'   ```
#'
#'   You can supply an optional list or data frame that will be
#'   converted to an environment.
#'
#'   ```{r, comment = "#>", collapse = TRUE}
#'   eval(code, mtcars)
#'   ```
#'
#'   Evaluation of defused code then occurs in the context of a data
#'   mask.
#'
#'
#' @section History:
#'
#' The tidyverse embraced the data-masking approach in packages like
#' ggplot2 and dplyr and eventually developed its own programming
#' framework in the rlang package. None of this would have been
#' possible without the following landmark developments from S and R
#' authors.
#'
#' - The S language introduced data scopes with [attach()] (Becker,
#'   Chambers and Wilks, The New S Language, 1988).
#'
#' - The S language introduced data-masked formulas in modelling
#'   functions (Chambers and Hastie, 1993).
#'
#' - Peter Dalgaard (R team) wrote the frametools package in 1997. It
#'   was later included in R as [base::transform()] and
#'   [base::subset()]. This API is an important source of inspiration
#'   for the dplyr package. It was also the first apparition of
#'   _selections_, a variant of data-masking extended and codified
#'   later on in the [tidyselect
#'   package](https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/articles/syntax.html).
#'
#' - In 2000 Luke Tierney (R team) [changed
#'   formulas](https://github.com/wch/r-source/commit/a945ac8e) to
#'   keep track of their original environments. This change published
#'   in R 1.1.0 was a crucial step towards hygienic data masking,
#'   i.e. the proper resolution of symbols in their original
#'   environments. Quosures were inspired by the environment-tracking
#'   mechanism of formulas.
#'
#' - Luke introduced [base::with()] in 2001.
#'
#' - In 2006 the [data.table package](https://r-datatable.com)
#'   included data-masking and selections in the `i` and `j` arguments
#'   of the `[` method of a data frame.
#'
#' - The [dplyr package](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) was published
#'   in 2014.
#'
#' - The rlang package developed tidy eval in 2017 as the data-masking
#'   framework of the tidyverse. It introduced the notions of
#'   [quosure][faq-quosure], [implicit injection][injecting] with `!!`
#'   and `!!!`, and [data pronouns][.data].
#'
#' - In 2019, injection with `{{` was introduced in [rlang
#'   0.4.0](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/06/rlang-0-4-0/) to
#'   simplify the defuse-and-inject pattern. This operator allows
#'   beginners to transport data-masked arguments across functions
#'   more intuitively.
